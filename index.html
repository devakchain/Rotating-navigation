        <h1>Anime Article</h1>
        <p>
          Though usually a laid-back, optimistic, jovial, humble and eccentric
          man, Urahara shows a deceptively cunning and serious side when the
          situation warrants it. He commonly uses idle conversation and outward
          concern to distract his opponents.[5] Despite his care-free attitude,
          he always speaks politely but carries a sarcastic wit. Yoruichi
          Shihōin notes he tends to go over the top with whatever he becomes
          passionate about. He has described himself as a "mere honest,
          handsome, perverted businessman". Approximately 110 years ago,
          Urahara's personality was slightly opposite of what it is in the
          present. During his earlier years as a captain, he was viewed as a
          nervous, flustered, and quiet person. Somewhat unsure of himself, he
          lacked confidence in his ability to be a good leader. In addition, he
          was occasionally confused with how to deal with his division. Despite
          being uncomfortable in his role, he seemed relatively at ease in his
          previous position at the 2nd Division Detention Unit. However, he
          eventually hardened his resolve to take on his role as captain by
          becoming more serious and determined. Urahara can usually be found
          near the scene of an important event, but he rarely intervenes in
          situations, preferring to stay on the sidelines. He often knows more
          information than he lets on, and despite being a major player in the
          situation, he acts only as a catalyst, having others do the work for
          him. Urahara is often manipulative, tricking people into doing what he
          wants them to. A recurring hobby of his tends to be building large
          secret underground training spaces. Kisuke is a pragmatic combatant,
          believing that using any means necessary in a life-and-death battle is
          essential in victory and survival, such as forming an alliance with
          Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez beforehand to defeat Askin Nakk Le Vaar via a
          sneak attack from behind.[6]

        <h3>Kisuke Urahara</h3>
        <img src="images/kisuke.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Kisuke is a tall, lean man with light skin and gray eyes. His hair is
          messy and light-blond (almost pale), with strands framing the sides of
          the face and hanging between his eyes, and he has chin stubble. He
          wears a dark green samue. Over this, he wears a black haori, which
          sports a white diamond pattern along its bottom half, reminiscent of
          an inverted captain's haori. Urahara carries a fan, which he
          occasionally uses to hide his face. He usually wears traditional
          Japanese wooden sandals (geta) and a striped dark green and white
          bucket hat (which usually shadows his eyes),[2] which has earned him
          the nickname "sandal-hat" (ゲタ帽子, geta-bōshi; "Mr. Hat-and-Clogs"
          in the English dub). During his earlier years in Soul Society, he had
          a clean-shaved face and wore the standard Shinigami shihakushō. In his
          more casual events, he usually wore his geta.[3] He later wore a
          long-sleeved captain's haori after his promotion to the rank of
          captain.[4]
